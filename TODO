If you want to colaborate, create a recipe to compile a new emulator!

A good list of emulators is available here:
https://github.com/herrwiese/gentoo-portage/tree/master/games-emulation

Please let me know if you are working on a recipe for a new emulator,
sending an e-mail to sergio.prado@e-labworks.com.
